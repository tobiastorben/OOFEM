OOFEM:

Components:

Simulation manager:
	main() entry point
	CLI manager
	Call input parser
	Call preprossor
	Call solver
	Call postprocessor
	Call GUI
	
	
Model library:
	Object oriented hiearcy of element types
		Element
			1D
				BAR
					TRUSS
				BEAM
					FEAME
			2D
				PLANE MEMBRANE
					PLANE STRESS
					PLANE STRAIN
				PLATE
					KIRCHOFF
					REISSNER-MINDLIN
				SHELL
					FLAT					
			3D
				SOLID
				AXISSYMMETRIC
				
		Different variations of each
			Quadrilaterals
			Triangular
			Serendipity
		    Ways of dealing with shear locking, hour glassing asf.
	Eech element type contains
		Function to return element stiffness matrix from element details input
		Function to integrate loads over element and distribute to it's nodes
		How to transform to global coordinates
		Calculate stress, strain, bending moment from node displacements
	Macro elements
	
Input parser:
	XML format
	TinyXML -> DOM
	Input file sections:
		Simulation options
		Element types
		Material types
		Topology
		BC's
	Macro elements for rapid mesh generation
	Look up element types in model library
	Return Model object
	
Preprocessor:
	Prepare the data in the Model object for submission to solver
	Calculate element stiffness matrices for each element
	Assemble into global stiffness matrix
	Distribute loads to nodes
	A lot of the work will be on the element models them selfes
	Return linear system to solver (preferrably sparse)
	Show graphical preview before continuing to solver?
	
Solver
	Purely mathematical operations, completely abstracted from the structural analysis
	Preconditioning
		Ill conditioned?
		Change system to be able to solve
	System solver
		Iterative
			Gauss-Seidel
			Jacobi
			Conjugate gradient
		Factorizations
			LU decompositions
				Doolittle
				Kraut
				Cholesky
			QR factorization
		Direct
			Gauss-Jordan
				Partial pivoting
		Use linear algebra library
			Eigen?
			Boost?
			BLAS, LAPACK wrapper?
			
Postprocessor
	Based on simulation options in the input file
	Stress
	Strain
	Deflection
	Maximum values
	Write output file
	Plot results
	
GUI
	Display structure and analysis results
	Camera controller
	Stress contours

Utility library
	Often used functions
	Shape functions
	Gaussian integration points and weights
